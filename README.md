PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Many people struggle to maintain healthy habits due to a lack of motivation, reminders, and personalized guidance. Most fitness apps offer generic features without adapting to individual routines.
To solve this, we aim to develop a smart fitness app using Android Studio, Jetpack Compose, Firebase, and Gemini API that tracks daily activities, sends timely alerts, and provides AI-driven suggestions to help users
stay active and healthy.

1. Frontend (Jetpack Compose):
Build a clean, responsive UI for activity tracking, progress display, and notifications.
2. Backend (Firebase):
Use Firebase Authentication for login, Firestore for storing user activity data, and Cloud Messaging for notifications.
3. AI Integration (Gemini API):
Analyze user data to generate personalized fitness tips, daily summaries, and motivational alerts.
4. Notifications:
Send real-time reminders for steps, hydration, and inactivity using Firebase and AI suggestions.
5. Testing & Deployment:
Test the app on emulators and real devices, then deploy via internal testing or Play Store.
